# NotificationManager
A Unity framework for prioritized in-game alerts. Notifications are ScriptableObjects with titles, messages, icons, duration, and importance, styled by color. A manager loads from PlayFab, queues by priority, and dispatches to animated UI panels, while socket notifiers turn events into user-facing messages.
