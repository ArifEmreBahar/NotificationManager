# NotificationManager
The Notification System is a Unity framework for delivering in-game alerts through a structured, prioritized flow. Notifications are defined as ScriptableObjects with titles, messages, icons, durations, and importance levels, styled by color for clarity. A Notification Library manages predefined sets, while the static Notification Manager loads definitions from PlayFab, queues messages by priority, and dispatches them in timed sequences. The Notification UI listens for events, animating modal panels that display content and close automatically when the queue is empty. Socket notifiers integrate external events like failed invitations or room joins, converting them into user-facing messages. The result is a scalable, extensible system for consistent, prioritized, and visually clear feedback across gameplay and platform contexts.
